# Twoâ€™s Complement Checksum for Memory

The purpose of this project is to build a data input system and memory integrated with Checksum
algorithm by using an FPGA on Basys 3 board. The project is an example of creating a system to
perform sophisticated computations by combining different components on the FPGA.
